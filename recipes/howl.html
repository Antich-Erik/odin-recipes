    <h1>Howl's beacon & eggs breakfast</h1>

    <p><img src="../images/howl.jpg"></p>

    <h3><em>Sizzling breakfast served up courtesy of Calcifer's demonic flames</em></h3>

    <p>Howl's Moving Castle is one of the many exquisitely animated (and profoundly confusing) expressions of destiny, growth, and love brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. </p>

    <p>Can some at-home know-how help us bring the magic into our own kitchens?</p>

    <h4><em>Ingredients</em></h4>

    <ul>

        <li>8 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt as required</li>
        <li>150g Of bacon</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup of parsley</li>
        <li>Black pepper as required</li>

    </ul>

    <h4><em>How to cook it?</em></h4>

    <ol>

        <li>Fry bacon in a pan on medium-low flame until they are crispy. Transfer them into a plate.</li>
        <li>Use the same pan to cook eggs. Crack eggs in the pan and cook them as you like; sunny side up. Cover the pan so that the egg cooks properly. Slice cherry tomatoes and cook in the pan at the same time.</li>
        <li>Add seasoning and garnish with chopped fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve bacon and eggs hot and enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
