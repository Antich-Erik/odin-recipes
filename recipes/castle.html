    <h3><em>It is also called 'winter vegetable stew'. Earthy and sweet!</em></h3>

    <p>Comforting, steaming stew that Sheeta makes in Castle in the Sky.</p>

    <p>Just thinking about it is making us salivate a little.</p>

                <li>Sake, 5 Tablespoons</li>

            </ul>

        </li>

    </ul>

    <h4><em>How to cook it?</em></h4>

    <ol>

        <li>Rinse the konnyaku, and score both sides. Using a spoon, cut off bite-size pieces. The spoon and the scoring makes more surface area to absorb the broth.</li>
        <li>Boil the konnyaku for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the lotus root, burdock root, carrots, and shiitake mushrooms into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Add a splash of rice vinegar to a bowl of water, and let the burdock and lotus roots soak for 15 minutes or more to prevent discoloring and also to tone down its strong flavor.</li>
        <li>Boil the lotus and burdock roots in water for about 10 minutes, to give them a head start in cooking. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Trim excess fat off of the chicken, and cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat, and add the sesame oil. Sautee the chicken until white.</li>
        <li>Add all of the vegetables to the pot. Sautee and coat with the oil.</li>
        <li>Add the sake, and let it come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the mirin, sugar, water, and soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer, turn the heat down, and place the lid on the pot so that a bit of steam can escape. Let it simmer for 30 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, checking every so often to make sure there is enough liquid. Add water as needed.</li>
        <li>Let the nimono cool, then place it in the refrigerator for at least a few hours, preferably a day.</li>
        <li>Enjoy at room temperature!</li>
